# Reference Architecture
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to gather information and experiments related to reference architectures. The idea is to collect and evaluate alternatives for common needs of software development projects.

Many times in projects we are faced with solution decisions and having at hand some tested and already studied alternatives may facilitate the choices in the design and speed up initial implementations.

## Approach
The main approach is to produce small Proof of Concepts(POCs) together with relevant background and reference information, as well as applicable situations, alternative solutions. Whenever possible, executable prototypes and examples will be provided.

The study and experiments will be grouped by area of interest or similar technologies, in order to facilitate future references.

The content organization may be inspired in some moments by books like [1], as they provide a good structure on how to organize studies of patterns.
