# Composition with Divs and SVG
## Intent
Use a composition of different elements to create a visual representation.

## Motivation
We may need to create a representation by composing simpler compoments and elements, for example styled div components decorated with other drawing primitives in SVG.  
This compositions could be used to represent graphs and other similar flows.
