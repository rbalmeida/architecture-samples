# Web Frontends
## Objective
The purpose of this section is to gather information on studies and experiments of web frontends.

## Alternatives
* Simple Html and JavaScript
* Simple Html and JavaScript, and simple framework, e.g jQuery
* Lightweight framework, e.g. Vue
* More complete framework, e.g. Angular

For a simple app possible html and JavaScript could be sufficient.  
If a little more dynamic computation is required, maybe JavaScript with the help of jQuery.  
With a minor level of complexity, the need of a few components, possibly Vue could be an option.  
For a more complete application a more complete framework could be necessary, for example Angular.

## Option for Angular
This section is not mean to do a comparison of JavaScript frameworks, and the option for Angular at the moment is based on personal experience with it.
