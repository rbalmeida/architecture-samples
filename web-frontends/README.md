# Web Frontends
## Objective
The purpose of this section is to gather information on studies and experiments of web frontends.

## Alternatives
* Simple Html and JavaScript
* Simple Html and JavaScript, and simple framework, e.g jQuery
* Other frameworks, e.g. Angular, React and ohers.
* Web Components

For a simple app possible html and JavaScript could be sufficient.  
If a little more dynamic computation is required, maybe JavaScript with the help of jQuery.  
For more advanced cases a framework may be used.

## Experiences with frameworks
There are several options of frameworks but the main focus on this section will be on general paterns and architecures, with a framework being a tool for that.

## Micro Frontends
Micro Frontends is an interesting concept and encapsulates some patterns for the construction of frontends as a composition of pages or page fragments from different teams. Geers (2020) provides a extensive discussion on the theme.
