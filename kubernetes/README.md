# Kubernetes
## Purpose
The purpose of this section is to gather information and experiments on Kubernetes for its applicability on the design and implementation of Application Platforms.

## What is Kubernetes
From [1], "Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications".

## Why Kubernetes
The idea behind these studies and experiment was to find better and faster ways to deploy applications, having automated tasks as application server configuration and deployment, application scaling and replication.
Kubernetes is one of the systems for that purpose, in which it leverages the use of container images and configuration files to spawn an application and maitain it working properly.

## Base for Platforms
With the design and features of Kubernetes, it is a good choice of base technology for the development of application platforms. It allows us to focus on the features of the applications as it facilitates or automates other parts, for example network and DNS configurations, cluster high availability, resource allocation and control.

## Further Reading
The Kubernetes documentation in [1] is a good place to start if you need to learn more about it.
